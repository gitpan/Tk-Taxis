Tk/Taxis version 2.02
=====================

This module is a composite widget: a framed canvas with critter images that 
perform bacterial taxis within a choice chamber. Taxis is a form of movement 
found in simple organisms such as bacteria. Bacteria cannot sense differential
gradients of e.g. light or food along the length of their cells, so they cannot
simply swim toward the light or food, as they are unable to tell which direction
this would require. Instead they measure e.g. the concentration of food where
they are, swim a little, then measure the concentration again. If they find the 
concentration has increased, they reduce their tumbling frequency, i.e the 
probability they will make a random change in direction. This allows them to 
follow a biased random walk toward the source of food/light/etc.

The module requires Tk and its dependencies installed. In addition to the module
itself, a script called 'woodlice.pl' will be installed in perl's executable 
directory that demonstrates the use of the module. If you do not want this,
edit Makefile.PL to remove the EXE_FILES line.
